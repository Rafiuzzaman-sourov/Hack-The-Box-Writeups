# Hack-The-Box-Writeups

Welcome to my repository of Hack The Box (HTB) writeups â€” a collection of detailed walkthroughs for retired machines, challenges, and labs. Each writeup showcases practical exploitation techniques, methodology, and in-depth analysis used to solve the boxes from both red team (attacker) and blue team (defender) perspectives.

ðŸ“Œ What you'll find here:
Step-by-step enumeration, exploitation, and post-exploitation techniques

Use of modern tools & scripts (e.g., nmap, linpeas, gobuster, burpsuite, Metasploit, etc.)

Manual and automated methods

Privilege escalation strategies on both Linux and Windows

Real-world inspired vulnerabilities and CVEs

Custom payloads, exploits, and notes for learning & reference

ðŸ§  Goal:
To document, share, and solidify my learning in cybersecurity by breaking down HTB challenges into digestible, repeatable processes. Ideal for CTF learners, OSCP aspirants, and anyone pursuing practical offensive security skills.

ðŸš¨ Disclaimer: All writeups are for retired machines only. This repo is meant strictly for educational purposes. Do not use the knowledge for illegal or unethical activities.
